  "readme": "CallbackStream\n=====\n\n[![Build\nStatus](https://travis-ci.org/mcollina/callback-stream.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mcollina/callback-stream)\n\nIt is an idiot-proof variant of the\n[callback-stream](https://github.com/maxogden/node-concat-stream)\npackage.\n\nIt does everything callback-stream does, minus the concatenation.\nIn fact, it just callbacks you with an array containing your\ngood stuff.\n\nIt is based on the Stream 2 API, but it also works on node v0.8.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$: npm install callback-stream --save\n```\n\n## Pipe usage\n\n```\nvar callback = require('callback-stream')\n  , fs = require('fs')\n  , read = fs.createReadStream('readme.md')\n  , write = callback(function(err, data) {})\n\nread.pipe(write)\n```\n\n## Object mode usage\n\n```\nvar callback = require('callback-stream')\n  , opts = { objectMode: true }\n  , write = callback(opts, function(err, data) {\n      // this will print ['hello', 'world']\n      console.log(data)\n    })\n\nwrite.write('hello')\nwrite.write('world')\nwrite.end()\n```\n\n## Contributing to CallbackStream\n\n* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been\n  implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet\n* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't\n  requested it and/or contributed it\n* Fork the project\n* Start a feature/bugfix branch\n* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution\n* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it\n  in a future version unintentionally.\n\n## LICENSE - \"MIT License\"\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Matteo Collina, http://matteocollina.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
